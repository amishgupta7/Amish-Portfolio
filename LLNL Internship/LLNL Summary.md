# Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) Internship
### Summer 2025 | "STEM with Phones" Workshop

During my internship at **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)**, I participated in the "STEM with Phones" workshop, where I explored how the sensors in a standard smartphone can be used as scientific instruments to collect and analyze complex data. This experience moved me beyond theoretical classroom science and into the world of "noisy," real-world measurements that require careful modeling to understand.

## Laboratory Activities & Research
Over the course of the week, I conducted several experiments using phone-based sensors and data modeling:

* **Motion & Velocity Analysis:** I used the Phyphox app to measure phone movement across the X, Y, and Z axes. I then processed this raw data using displacement and velocity models to create visualizations that accurately described the phone's physical path.
* **GPS & Geospatial Data:** I utilized GPS sensors to track latitude and longitude changes in real time. By analyzing these graphs, I learned to interpret how small data shifts correspond to physical movement on a global scale.
* **Acoustics & Frequency:** I collected sound data through the phone’s microphone to identify specific frequencies. I used data analysis tools to graph these sound waves and isolate individual frequencies from the surrounding noise.
* **Optics & Color Theory:** I studied light refraction and the RGB/CMY color models. I even used phone-based microscopes to examine display pixels at the LED level, seeing firsthand how sensors measure light and color.
* **Electromagnetic Fields:** I used magnetic sensors to find the "North" side of magnets and calculated the angular velocity of a moving magnet. This required me to interpret electromagnetic field data to determine how the magnets were behaving in motion.
* **The National Ignition Facility (NIF):** A highlight of the week was touring the NIF, the world’s largest and highest-energy laser, which put the power of high-level physics into perspective.

## Learnings
Working at LLNL taught me that real-world data is rarely clean. I learned that the true job of a scientist or engineer is to apply rigorous analysis and visualization to "imperfect" data to uncover meaningful insights.
